# Naive-Bayes
Here you will find the Naive Bayes Algorithms which i worked on. Will apply Naive Bayes technique when dependent variable is discrete/category/binary.
It can be applied for both regression and classification but the regression model is not that much efficient.
Naive Bayes mainly works on Bayesian Theorem i.e conditional Probability.
